# Overview
This is a UCF Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project. The aim of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable model for predicting depression rates in a given FIPS code area. This project utilizes various parameters such as health, labor (economics), education, transportation, and weather to predict the depression rates. The datasets used in this project are being sourced from various government agencies and will be linked via the FIPS code. By combining and analyzing these datasets, we hope to create a powerful tool that can assist in identifying areas that may be at a higher risk of depression, and aid in the development of appropriate policies and interventions to reduce depression rates.


## Development
The current plan for this project is to clean the above sourced data into usable tables then run it into some form of ML model or regression. At that point, we will analyse the results to see what direction we need to push the model.

Once the data is at a point that results and correlations can be made, we will visualize the data on tableau and host the project on AWS so it is publically available outside of github.

## Data
The schema is as follows.
